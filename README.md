# Black-Box-System-Identification
Black Box System Identification Using MATLAB

ELE829 - System Modelling and Identification was a 4th year Electrical Engineering course at Ryerson, and its final project was to
identify a "Black Box" using MATLAB. A “Black-Box” system was taken into consideration and the objective was to determine the parametric
model of the system. Using MATLAB, a PRBS signal was generated which was used to collect the input-output data of the Black-Box system 
over N = 2000 samples with a switching rate of K = 50. The following repository contains the code written to identify and then succesfully
validate the system.

"project_blackbox_data" contains the data of the unknown system.
